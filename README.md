# Hot City

Hot City is a service depending on data that we collect from social network activity in the region of Patras. We then use this data to show you the most popular venues and areas in the city, depending on the day and time, showing you where local residents like to hang out.

# Instalation

# How to start

Login using one of the demo accounts that exits in the table "user" in the database and then start browsing the platform. The web based version of hot city allows you to select an area from the given map and save it. Then using the AR application you will be able to augment the POIs found around this area on a printed map.
